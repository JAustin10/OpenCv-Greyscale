# OpenCv-Greyscale
Greyscale is the process of converting an image from different color scales to shades of gray.It is mostly done to reduce the complexity of the image and since mostly algorithms are designed to work using greyscale images hence it is widely preffered.

There are multiple ways to implement Greyscale but here the method of cv.cvtColor() function has been used.

In order to implement the greyscale of an image,follow the given steps:-
STEP 1-Download the attached code.
STEP 2-Open the terminal and activate the virtual environment you have created.
STEP 3-Run the following command:

python "File Name.py"
